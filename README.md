[Probabilistic Numerics](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2015.0142) (PN) interprets classic numerical routines as
_inference procedures_ by taking a probabilistic viewpoint. This allows principled treatment of _uncertainty arising
from finite computational resources_. The vision of probabilistic numerics is to provide well-calibrated probability
measures over the output of a numerical routine, which then can be propagated along the chain of computation.

This repository aims to implement methods from PN in Python 3 and to provide a common interface for them. This is
currently a work in progress, therefore interfaces are subject to change.

## Installation
To get started install ProbNum using `pip`.
```bash
pip install probnum
```
